# University-Java-Assignment-3

This assigment assessed upon the following abilites:

* Understanding how software objects can be used to represent real-world objects;
* Demonstrating experience of problem solving and algorithm design;
* Understanding how to use the API documentation to explore what methods are available;
* Appreciating the difficulties involved in developing robust systems that involve the interaction of hardware and software, and operate in a real-world environment. 

This Java program involved programming a Lego Mindstorm Robot to navigate a grid of coloured dots linked by black lines. The robot was expected to be able to set out, find the grid and explore it, whilst also memorising the location of each coloured dot it meets. Furthermore, the robot was expected to "sing" a tune (bleep) when encountering a second dot of a colour it had already found and then set off directly to the first dot, this time without following lines of the grid. when reaching the first dot it would then dance (spin) to indicate the program has finished.

This program achieved the tasks outlined above and makes use of the javadoc facility to explain how the algorithms were designed and implemented.
